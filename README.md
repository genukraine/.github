GEN Ukraine has integrated various types of intentional communities into a network: ecovillages, family estates, art communities, spiritual communities, cohauzings and communes, etc., as well as individual households and environmental initiatives, including transitional towns. The organization was created to contribute to the development of these communities, represent and protect their interests.

 

Ecovillages are groups of people who have consciously moved from the city to the countryside and created a community. They share common values. In most cases, it is caring for the environment, a healthy lifestyle and aspiration for more sustainable and harmonious interaction with the world.

 

Among the ecovillage people of Ukraine there are representatives of completely different professions. These are often people with higher education and successful careers. Some of them change their occupation, others continue to work remotely, and there are those who adapt their knowledge to the needs of the local community.

 

Ecovillages, it’s a way of living together, in trust, openness and desire to become better every day; living with love and gratitude to the "mother earth"; living with thoughts about children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren; living in the creation of a better world.

 

Ecovillages, it’s the daily restoration of rivers, streams, lakes and water cycles; restoration of soil, forests, biodiversity; responsible consumption, development of organic and biodynamic agriculture.

 

Ecovillages are places for green tourism, recreation, festivals, sites for invention, renewable energy experiments, educational seminars, restoration of crafts and authentic cuisine, an opportunity to learn about the culture of our nation for people from around the world.

 

Ecovillage people contribute to the development of local communities, the local education system, the local economy.

 

The Global Ecovillage Network of Ukraine is part of the Global Ecovillage Network of Europe, which in turn is part of the Global Ecovillage Network of the world. The organization operates in the national and international arena, in the fields of education, advocacy, fighting climate change, volunteering, green energy, etc.

 

We believe that ecovillages are the future of a sustainable Ukraine!
